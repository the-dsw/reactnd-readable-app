# Readable: content and comment web app

This is the final extracurricular project for Udacity's Redux course. 
Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server and the front-end of the project.

```

## API Server
